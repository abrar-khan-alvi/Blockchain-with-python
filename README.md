**How the Application Works:**

1. Create a Wallet: Generate a new wallet with a public/private key pair.
2. Submit Transactions: Using the walletâ€™s private key, submit transactions (e.g., send cryptocurrency to another wallet).
3. Mine New Blocks: Mine a new block that validates pending transactions from the pool and appends them to the blockchain.
4. Explore the Blockchain: View all blocks and their transaction history using the blockchain explorer.
